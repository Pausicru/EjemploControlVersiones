## R Markdown

Area de un c√≠rculo

```{r}
r<- 0.5
Areas <- pi*r^2
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
